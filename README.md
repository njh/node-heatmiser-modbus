node-heatmiser-modbus
=====================

node.js library and command line tool for controlling [Heatmiser] Modbus Thermostats.

It has been tested with the following devices:
* [Heatmiser Edge]
* [Heatmiser Touch-E v2]


Installation
------------

To install in your local project:
```sh
npm install heatmiser-modbus
```

Or to install globally and make easy use of the `hmmb` command line tool:
```sh
npm install -g heatmiser-modbus
```


Wiring
------

To connect a Heatmiser Modbus Thermostat to a computer, you need a RS-485 adaptor.

I initially had some trouble with connecting using a short (1m) cable during testing, until I discovered that the termination resistor in the Heatmiser Edge had to be switched *off* for short distances.

The following RS-485 interfaces have been tested with:
* [Waveshare USB to RS485 Bidirectional Converter](https://www.waveshare.com/product/iot-communication/wired-comm-converter/usb-to-rs485.htm)
* [Waveshare USB to RS232/485/TTL Converter](https://www.waveshare.com/product/iot-communication/wired-comm-converter/usb-to-rs232-uart-fifo/usb-to-rs232-485-ttl.htm?sku=15817)

There are some very expensive industrial RS-485 interfaces out there.
But I have found [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/) to be a good balance between cost and quality.

To connect everything together, I used a 1 pair Screened 24-AWG RS-485 Cable:

As the Heatmiser devices do not have a RS-485 signal ground terminal, I left them disconnected.
But I looped the shielding through between devices and connected the ground on the Waveshare adaptor.


Command Line Tool
-----------------

The `hmmb` command line tool is provided to configure and control thermostats, without having to write any JavaScript.

Two things are required to use the tool:
* The path to the serial port, that the modbus devices are connected to
* The Unit Identifier (aka Communications ID) of the thermostat to talk to

These can be provided as command line options, or via environment variables.
If the Modbus Unit Identifier is not given, it defaults to 1.

```

JavaScript Example
------------------

```
const {Client} = require('heatmiser-modbus')

// Create a new client with path to the serial port device
const client = new Client('/dev/ttyUSB0')

// Add a thermostat with Communications ID = 1
const thermostat = client.addThermostat(1)

// Connect to the serial port
client.connect()
  .then(() => {
    // Once connected, send a modbus command to set the temperature
    const target = 20.5
    console.log("Setting temperature to: ", target)
    return thermostat.setTargetTemperature(target)
  })
  .then(() => {
    // If successful
    console.log("Done.")
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // If there was an error
    console.error('Error!', err)
  })
  .finally(() => {
